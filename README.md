# Efficient 2D Spatial Data Storage with KD-Tree in Python
This project implements an efficient system for storing and retrieving 2D spatial data using a KD-tree. The KD-tree is a data structure designed to organize points in a multi-dimensional space, allowing for fast querying and retrieval operations. This implementation also supports the storage of duplicate data, ensuring flexibility in handling various types of datasets.

## Key Features
* #### Efficient Data Representation
> The project uses a KD-tree to store 2D spatial data (e.g., geographic coordinates or map points). The structure is designed for quick retrieval of data, making it  > ideal for handling large datasets.

* #### Duplicate Data Support
> Unlike other methods, this KD-tree implementation supports storing duplicate data, ensuring the flexibility to handle real-world datasets that may contain repeated > points.

* #### User-Friendly Visualization
> The project integrates TkinterMapView to provide an interactive map interface, allowing users to visualize and explore the stored 2D data on a map.

* #### Scalability and Performance
> The KD-tree is designed to efficiently scale with increasing amounts of spatial data, maintaining performance even with large datasets.
